# hattivatti

`hattivatti` is a job submission service for the INTERVENE platform. For each requested job instance it configures compute resources to:

* transfer and decrypt on the fly data to a secure area (i.e. a bucket)
* calculate polygenic scores using the PGS Catalog Calculator
* upload results to a different secure area (i.e. a different bucket)
* monitor and notify the backend about job status

The main component is `pyvatti`, a FastAPI application that sets up a standard API for the job submission service to deploy across different environments (cloud or HPC). 

`pyvatti` should be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, and a Helm chart is available to simplify deployment.

PGS Catalog Calculator jobs are installed to the local Kubernetes cluster as Job objects, but compute happens externally (Cloud Batch / SLURM).

## Deploying jobs with Google Cloud Platform

    Backend->>pyvatti: Launch a job please
    pyvatti->>Backend: Done
    pyvatti->>Cloud Storage: Make buckets
    pyvatti->>Nextflow Job: helm install nextflow Job (GKE)
    Nextflow Job->>Cloud Batch: Launch workers
    Nextflow Job->>Seqera:Monitoring
    loop Every minute
    pyvatti->>Seqera:Poll job status
    Note over Seqera,pyvatti: Until error or success
    end
    Seqera->>pyvatti:Job status: success
    pyvatti->>Backend:Notify
    pyvatti->>Nextflow Job:helm uninstall
    pyvatti->>Cloud Storage:Clean up    
```

The basic idea is that the python application:

* builds a helm values file from the API call
* creates compute resources, including:
  * buckets for doing work
  * installing a job to the local Kubernetes cluster (`helmvatti`) using the helm CLI
* monitors and manages the resources for the lifetime of the job
