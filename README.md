# hattivatti

`hattivatti` is a job submission service for the INTERVENE platform. For each requested job instance it configures compute resources to:

* transfer and decrypt on the fly data to a secure area (i.e. a bucket)
* calculate polygenic scores using the PGS Catalog Calculator
* upload results to a different secure area (i.e. a different bucket)

The service also monitors the status of submitted jobs and forwards updates to the INTERVENE platform backend.

* `pyvatti` is a FastAPI application that sets up a standard API for the job submission service
* `helmvatti` is a Helm chart that installs a Job on a Kubernetes cluster

## Deploying jobs with Google Cloud Platform
